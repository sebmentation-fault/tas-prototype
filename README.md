# prototyping and testing playground for take a selfie or whatever it gets called

what each directory is used for:

* [templates-prototype](/templates-prototype/) has simple, hard coded HTML pages
  so that we can see how the sketches would feel when implemented
* [t3-prototype](/t3-prototype/takeaselfie) lets us explore if the t3 stack is
  a good choice. comments on installation found in [this README](/t3-prototype/README.md)
* TBC - more directories for different frontend/backend combinations so that we
  can explore which tech stack would be most favourable/maintainable
